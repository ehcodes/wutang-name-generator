## How It's Made:

**Tech Used:** HTML, CSS, Vanilla Javascript

This name generator uses the length property to pick an index number from two seperate arrays in order to provide the user with a wutang clan name.

## Optimizations:

I would change my if functions into else if's that would chain to the if else function. I wasn't comfortable doing this at first because I saw them as unrelated tasks but looking back it seems like that would be the natural choice.

## Lessons Learned:
Go with my gut instinct!
